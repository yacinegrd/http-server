# Python Web Server
I built this project to deepen my backend knowlodge and understand the HTTP protocol on a deeper level

## Testing
to test this project clone the project go to the main directory and then just run this commande :

```
python server.py
```

Then just do request to localhost:8080 *(default)* using Postman or your favorite browser

> [!NOTE]
> the server will run on **localhost:8080** you can change that in the "server.py" file by changing the adresse and port constants
