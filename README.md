# Python Web Server
I built this project to deepen my backend knowlodge and understand the HTTP protocol on a deeper level

## Testing
To test the project clone the project then go to the main directory and just run this commande :

```
python server.py
```

Finnaly you can make requests using Postman or your favorite browser to test the project

> [!NOTE]
> the server will run on **localhost:8080** you can change that in the "server.py" file by changing the adresse and port constants

> [!WARNING]
> This project is still in developement
